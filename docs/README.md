# Store theme on VTEX IO

 Store theme created for the project proposed by the course given by Gama Academy and VTEX companies.
 
 I couldn't finish it in time to deliver the full project, but I'm still learning a lot to use it better.
 The store should have banner with a slider showing the main promotions on the store, a gallery showing products of each tab clicked, a react component for contact support on Whatsapp and another react component for the registration of the clients who'd like to receive promotions on their e-mail.
